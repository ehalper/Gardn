# Gardn iOS Application
The Gardn iOS application is designed to help plant owners maintain the health of their plants. It keeps track of plants' watering schedules by sending customized reminder notifications based on the plant. Another feature is camera and camera roll access in order to upload and show a photo on each plant's profile. The application also utilizes persistence for maintaining the userâ€™s plants data.
